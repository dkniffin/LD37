# Ideas
- Escape the room
- Shifting room
- Small character (ant, hamster, shrunken, etc)
 - Story:
  - You're an inventor who's created a shrink machine, and accidentally shrunk yourself, inside your workshop. Your goal is to un-shrink yourself. That will involve finding info on your computer about how to reverse the effects, doing some calculations on your calculator, gathering parts, and assemble them with some tools.
 - Stages:
  - Get to the computer - Simple platforming section, which will be a good way to tell people the controls.
  
  2. - Computer - You'll need to research how to un-shrink yourself, by pushing the mouse to the right spot (a search bar), and entering some info ("unshrink ray"), then clicking the result. It should be a yahoo answer or something comical.
  
  1. - Part collection - This will be a platformer/puzzle stage, where you have to work your way through various obstacles, to get to various items. For 1.0, item collection could be as simple as picking them up, but another idea would be to have to push them all back to a common area.
  
  3. - Assembly - Once you have all the parts, and you're in the workbench area, you have to put them together. This will involve getting tools into the right place, and using them on the parts, to match a picture, perhaps.
   - Tool ideas: 
    - Soldering iron, with a circuit diagram
    - Wrench that has to be spun around by pushing
    
  - Calculation - Once it's assembled, we need to enter some number in the device. This could be something you need to find, or maybe you come up with it by entering things in a calculator, or writing on some paper.
  
  5. - Plug it in - This could be another platforming stage, but with the twist that you have a cord attached to you. Maybe it provides a disadvantage, because it can get caught on things, but it can also be used to swing across gaps, and the plug can be thrown to make a bridge.
  
  4. - Chemical station - Mix various chemicals to make some ingredient needed for the unshrink ray.
  
 - Parts:
  - Cord - Maybe we have to get some scissors and cut a cord from something else
  - Shrink-wrap - We should collect this from the shrink ray, for re-use in the un-shrink ray.
  - Circuit board - Take this from some broke-down electronics in the room 
   - TODO: what's something funny for this?
  - Capacitor x3
  - Resistor x2

# Intro text

Doctor Keller was working late in his lab, as usual

He had spent so many hours working on the device

But today was the day. He finally finished it!

He knew he should have waited until daytime, when his assistant would be around

But he just couldn't contain his excitement. He was sure it would work as intended

In his excitement, what he failed to consider is what he would do AFTER it worked

He plugged the device in and turned it on

<Change to white>

There was a flash of light, and a beam of energy from the device

Dr Keller was certainly not a tall man, but he wasn't short either. That was about to change

When the beam hit him, he shrunk from over 5 feet tall, down to a mere inch!

# Todo

- Animate capacitor and resistor
- Ability to click gurgle search
- Finish platforming area
- Create a cupboard area
